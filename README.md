### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mack, a software engineer living in Los Angeles, CA. I'm passionate about Scala and learning as much as I can about building, monitoring and scaling backend distributed systems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Scala, Akka, Akka Streams, Kafka, Google PubSub Finagle, to name a few things.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Core Frameworks team at Credit Karma.
